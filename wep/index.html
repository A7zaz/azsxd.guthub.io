Hello everyone, I introduce myself, my name is Abdullah Mishaal Al-Balawi, a university student, I study at Taibah University, which is my first year. I took the initiative to learn programming languages, which are my hobby since childhood. I'm just standing here. No, I will do my best to reach the highest levels and highlight myself, God willing. I will mention to you what I learned to make this page or this web.
